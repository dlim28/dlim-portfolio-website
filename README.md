# Design Process

## **Theme of portfolio**

The theme that was decided was a more minimalist style with subtle colors that will be eye catching by not being bold.
The initial moodboard that was craeted in pinterest even made the following suggestions simply due to the aesthetic that was chosen

## **Mood Board**
As the moodboard was a rather large board (77 items) it was necessary to break it down into other boards to that a commonality could be extracted.

***Seperation of portfolios***

The mood board was serperated into three types:

- Color: [LINK](https://www.pinterest.com.au/darrenlim193/portfolio-colors/)
- Texture: [LINK](https://www.pinterest.com.au/darrenlim193/portfolio-texturepattern/)
- Design/Aesthetic: [LINK](https://www.pinterest.com.au/darrenlim193/portfolio-texturepattern/)

A color board was necessary so that I could see what was naturally gravitating towards to. A lot of the colours that were picked tended to be darker colors such as black or a dark blue with the content in a contrasting colour so that it appears against the background.

The texture board essentially shows the type of backgrounds and patterns that I like and feel work in the context of the image shown. Most of the images shown were mainly flat or had a subtle pattern with a dark color. Some images had some bumps or wrinkles on it that made it look like rough paper. This was probably due to the selection of playing card related images that were used on the mood board.

The design or aesthetic board was mainly used to pick images that generally had the content in a good position where it can stand out. Most of the images had a good use of negative space that had the content centered.

## ***Font choices***

### **Serif Fonts**
The Serif font was mainly used for headings and subheadings. Due to the website having a minimalist theme, the choice was narrowed down to Bitter. Proportionaly the Bitter font was even and the width was almost the same for all letters with the serif extruding a little bit to add flair to the design.

### **Sans-Serif Fonts**
With the whole minimalist design it seems that there was a plethora of sans-serif fonts available. The decision to use Merriweather Sans was a tough choice because Work Sans was equally a compelling choice. The reasoning behind using Merriweather Sans was due to the slight thickness over Work Sans. It allowed Merriweather Sans to contrast on a dark canvas a lot better.

# Short Answer QnA

## ***Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today***
```
-ARPANET was created and used in the millitary for sending data over a network. This millitary project is what would influence the modern internet to this day.
-TCP/IP was invented as a set of protocols soon after and became the backbone in what is the internet today. All data would be using this set of protocols in order to send and recieve information
- With the foundations of the Internet and its protocols in place, the next big thing would be the proposal of the Top Level Domain (TLD) for the public as well as the proposal of the World Wide Web, also known to us as www
- With the Internet slowly gaining popularity in sending and receiving information, a method was needed to secure more sensitive information. Hence SSL was created and is still the industry standard in use today
```

## ***Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers***
```
-Domain: It is an name that is used to identify oneself in the context of the internet
-Web Server: A server whose communications mainly deal with incoming and outgoing internet connections
-DNS: A DMS (Domain Name Server) is a server that can translate an IP address to a readable format made for people. It is used to identify computers connected to the internet
-Web Browser: A web browser is an application for accessing content on the Internet
```

## ***Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today***
```
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the internet standard in sending and receiving electronic mail (E-mail). It was a protocol that was proposed to simply send mail through the current TCP/IP protocol and with it came the acceptance of the internet in most businesses as well as faster delivery and receiving times compared to traditional mail. 

With SMTP came the proposal of IMAP and POP3. They are 2 other types of protocols relating to the retrival of email through the open internet. These 3 protocols is what revolutionised the world to "instant mail" and increased most businesses productivity.

To this day the SMTP/IMAP or POP3 protocols are still the standard in email communication.
