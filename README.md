## Portfolio README

## Theme of portfolio

I like plain simple colours with other colours that stand out as subtle textures

## Mood Board
***Seperation of portfolios***

Serperated into three types:

- Color (Pins that have a colour that were striking to me)
- Texture (A specific texture or pattern that was striking to me at first notice)
- Design/aesthetic (The way something was placed that made it immediately stand out)

Seperated because hoping to find a trend in all three to build a portfolio website out of
